      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Kassy Raymond is a PhD Candidate in Computational Sciences at the University of Guelph, supervised by Dr. Deborah Stacey and Dr. Andrew Hamilton-Wright in the School of Computer Science.

Her research focuses on applying data governance principles to improve the quality, discoverability, and reusability of animal health and production data disseminated by intergovernmental and governmental sources. She is especially interested in using graph databases to strengthen data infrastructure and enable interoperability across open data sources.

Kassyâ€™s work is informed by an interdisciplinary background spanning biology, bioinformatics, machine learning, data science, and data governance. She previously served as Technical Manager for the GBADs Informatics theme and has presented internationally at five venues, including a special session on interoperability at the UN FAO in Rome and the launch of the Datasphere Initiative during a G7 multistakeholder meeting. She is a former Datasphere Fellow and the first-ever Data Engineer to work at Public Health in Ontario.

Her research has been recognized through several prestigious awards, including the NSERC Canada Graduate Scholarship â€“ Doctoral (CGS-D), the Ontario Graduate Scholarship, the Queen Elizabeth II Graduate Scholarship in Science and Technology, and the SoCS Summer Doctoral Award.

She holds an MSc in Bioinformatics and a BSc in Biological Sciences, both from the University of Guelph.
