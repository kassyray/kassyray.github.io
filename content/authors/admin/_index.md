      This thesis develops a metadata-driven graph database framework that harmonizes livestock data classifications and vocabularies from intergovernmental and national sources, enhancing interoperability and enabling discovery of disparate data sources. Through a qualitative review of metadata, data, and data systems, this research establishes a bottom-up methodology for developing community-driven standards.

      GPA: 4.0/4.0

      This thesis developed an unsupervised machine-learning pipeline to analyze Electrodermal Activity (EDA) as a sympathetic-nervous-system stress marker. We applied DBSCAN and k-means clustering to time-series features extracted over multiple window lengths (3-120 seconds) from Biopac and Empatica E4 recordings. A novel visualization for cluster dynamics was created and demonstrated that analyzing Empatica E4 signals with longer window lengths are able to identify regions of stress at a comparable level to signals collected from Biopac.
