summary: An exploration of data governance and graph‑database frameworks to enhance the quality, discoverability, and interoperability of global animal health and production data.

abstract: 'In this talk, Kassy Raymond—PhD Candidate in Computational Sciences at the University of Guelph—outlines the data requirements, challenges, and emerging opportunities for global animal health research and decision‑making. Drawing on her work with the Global Burden of Animal Diseases (GBADs) knowledge engine, she demonstrates how operationalizing data governance principles and leveraging graph databases can strengthen metadata‑driven search and classification across open intergovernmental and national sources. Kassy highlights the implications for tracking climate change impacts, antimicrobial resistance, food security, and zoonotic disease, and discusses the pathway toward more transparent, reusable, and equitable data systems.'
